# 🌍 **Language Detection using NLP**  

This project demonstrates a simple **Language Detection Model** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model can identify languages such as **English**, **Spanish**, and **French** based on input text.

---

## 🚀 **Key Features**  
- Preprocessing text data (tokenization, normalization).  
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  
- Classification using **Logistic Regression**.  
- Evaluation metrics for performance assessment.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **NLTK**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To build a simple yet effective **Language Detection System** using NLP techniques and machine learning classifiers.  

---

## 📊 **Results**  
The model achieves good accuracy in detecting text languages across the dataset.
